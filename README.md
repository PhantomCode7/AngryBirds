Hi , 
To run the project you need to go to gradle -> project name -> tasks -> application ->run.
After you run , a login/signup screen will be displayed , clicking on either of the buttons will lead
you to the main menu .
In main menu , there are three options , new game , load game and exit game , clicking on the new game 
directly starts a new game (level 1 ) , clicking on load game leads you to level selection screen .
Levels which are in white colour are locked levels and levels in the other colour are unlocked levels .
Clicking on either of the unlocked level buttons  leads you to Game Screen , in Game screen there are three
buttons , pause button , losing screen button ( cross in bottom left ) , winning screen (tick mark) button
Clicking on pause leads you to pause screen. 
Clicking on cross button leads you  to losing screen. 
Clicking on tick mark button (in bottom right) leads you to winning screen . 
Buttons on the winning screen , losing screen and the pause screen are self-explanatory
Thank you for reading this .
Have a nice day !!
